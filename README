RDF-Redland-Model-ExifTool

This class:

	* extends the Redland RDF Libraries set of RDF statements, 
          or model, to process Exif meta data from ExifTool
	* is used by an example script, exif2rdf, to print
          Exif meta data from files as RDF statements

INSTALLATION

This class depends on non-core Perl modules and classes,
see PREREQ_PM in Makefile.PL .

Redland RDF Libraries (RDF::Redland) must be installed 
from a package or built from source.
For example on Ubuntu install packages librdf-perl and raptor-utils.
The Redland version on CPAN is out of date and fails
"make test".

To install this class, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
